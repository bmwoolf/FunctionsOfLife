Normally breeding can only occur between entities cross-species. But I think all entities that reproduce, have the exact same root functions.

Outline is:

1. Energy
2. Memory
3. Sense  
   a. sense  
   b. filter  
   c. store  
   d. access
4. Catch
5. Consume
6. Digest  
   a. breakDown  
   b. transportEnergy  
   c. useEnergy
7. Replicate
8. Defend
9. Repair
