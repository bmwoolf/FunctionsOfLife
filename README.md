Normally breeding can only occur between entities cross-species. But I think all entities that reproduce, have the exact same root functions.

Outline is:  
SenseResources

- sense
- filter
- store
- access

  Catch  
  Consume  
  Digest

- breakDown
- transportEnergy
- useEnergy

  Replicate  
  Defend
